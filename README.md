## Overview

This repository contains open hardware mechanical design files for an enclosure matching the [Environment Sensor](https://github.com/antmicro/environment-sensor) PCBs.
The enclosure has been optimized mechanically for PCBs in revision 1.0.3.
There are two major parts of the enclosure:

top enclosure - installed above the board, exposes the sensor island
bottom enclosure - installed below the board

The eclosure is designed to be assembled using 3x M2.5 screws.
